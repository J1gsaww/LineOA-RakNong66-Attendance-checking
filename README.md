# LineOA RakNong66 Attendance Checking

ðŸ˜€ This is a part of the QR Code Generator used in my event management for RakNong66 at Mahidol University.

ðŸ“² The process involves scanning the QR code to retrieve user information, which the admin will then send to the Line Official Account.

ðŸ¥° Feel free to explore the QR code generation [here](https://github.com/J1gsaww/QRCode-Generation-for-user-information.git).
