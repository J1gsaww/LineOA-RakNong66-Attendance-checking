<h1> LineOA RakNong66 Attendance Checking </h1>
ðŸ˜€ This is a part of the QR Code Generator used in my event management for RakNong66 at Mahidol University
<br>
ðŸ“² The process involves scanning the QR code to retrieve user information, which the admin will then send to the Line Official Account.
<br>
ðŸ¥° Feel free to explore the QR code generation here: https://github.com/J1gsaww/QRCode-Generation-for-user-information.git

The integration between Line Official Account and Google Sheet uses the services provided by "Make"
